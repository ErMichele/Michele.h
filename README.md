## Features Overview

### **1. Console Text Formatting**
Take your terminal output to the next level with customizable and colorful text:
- **Text Colors**: Add vibrancy with macros like `ROSSO` (Red), `VERDE` (Green), `GIALLO` (Yellow), and `CIANO` (Cyan).
- **Background Colors**: Create contrast using background macros such as `S_ROSSO` (Red Background) and `S_BLU` (Blue Background).
- **Text Styles**: Emphasize text with macros like `GRASSETTO` (Bold), `SOTTOLINEATO` (Underline), `LAMPEGGIANTE` (Blinking), and `INVERSIONE` (Inverted Text).

---

### **2. Mathematical Operations on Physical Quantities**
Perform accurate calculations on physical quantities with uncertainties:
- **Physical Quantity Structure (`Grandezza_Fisica`)**: Define quantities with a value (`Valore`) and uncertainty (`Incertezza`).
- **Supported Operations**:
  - **Addition & Subtraction**: Propagate uncertainties accurately with `Somma_Fisica` and `Differenza_Fisica`.
  - **Multiplication & Division**: Handle uncertainties in product and ratio calculations using `Prodotto_Fisica` and `Divisione_Fisica`.
  - **Power & Root**: Use `Potenza_Fisica` to elevate quantities to any power or `Radice_Fisica` to compute the n-th root, both with precise uncertainty propagation.

---

### **3. Advanced Mathematical Functions**
Solve challenging mathematical problems with ease:
- **Quadratic Equation Solver (`Formula_Quadratica`)**:
  - Solve quadratic equations \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \), returning both solutions (if they exist).
- **Fibonacci Sequence (`Fibonacci_Numero`)**:
  - Compute the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number efficiently.
- **Root Calculation (`Radice`)**:
  - Compute the n-th root of a number using Newtonâ€™s method, ensuring high precision.

---

### **4. Utility Functions**
Simplify your workflows with utility features:
- **String Conversion (`UniformaString`)**:
  - Normalize strings to lowercase for easier comparisons.
- **Logging with Timestamps (`Logging`)**:
  - Create detailed logs with timestamps for debugging and tracking program behavior. Logs are written to both the console and a file.
