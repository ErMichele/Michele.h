## Features Overview

### **1. Console Text Formatting**

Enhance your terminal output with customizable and vibrant text:

* **Text Colors**: Add color to your terminal output with macros:

  * `ROSSO`: Red text color.
  * `VERDE`: Green text color.
  * `GIALLO`: Yellow text color.
  * `BLU`: Blue text color.
  * `CIANO`: Cyan text color.

* **Background Colors**: Create contrast with background colors:

  * `S_ROSSO`: Red background color.
  * `S_VERDE`: Green background color.
  * `S_GIALLO`: Yellow background color.
  * `S_BLU`: Blue background color.

* **Text Styles**: Emphasize your messages using text styles:

  * `GRASSETTO`: Bold text style.
  * `SOTTOLINEATO`: Underlined text style.
  * `LAMPEGGIANTE`: Blinking text style.
  * `INVERSIONE`: Inverted text style.

* **Reset Formatting**: Reset to default formatting using:

  * `RESET`: Resets text formatting to default.

### **2. Mathematical Operations on Physical Quantities**

Easily perform operations on physical quantities while considering their uncertainties:

* **Physical Quantity Structure (`Grandezza_Fisica`)**: Define quantities that include both a value (`Valore`) and an uncertainty (`Incertezza`).

* **Supported Operations**:

  * **Addition & Subtraction**: Accurately propagate uncertainties using `Somma_Fisica` and `Differenza_Fisica`.
  * **Multiplication & Division**: Manage uncertainties in product and ratio calculations with `Prodotto_Fisica` and `Divisione_Fisica`.
  * **Power & Root**: Raise physical quantities to a power using `Potenza_Fisica`, or calculate the n-th root with `Radice_Fisica`, both with precise uncertainty handling.

---

### **3. Advanced Mathematical Functions**

Solve complex mathematical problems with ease:

* **Quadratic Equation Solver (`Formula_Quadratica`)**:

  * Solve quadratic equations of the form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$, returning both solutions (if they exist).

  **`Soluzioni_Quadratica` Structure**:

  * The structure that holds the solutions for a quadratic equation:

    * `Soluzione_PiÃ¹`: The positive solution (root).
    * `Soluzione_Meno`: The negative solution (root).

* **Fibonacci Sequence (`Fibonacci_Numero`)**:

  * Efficiently calculate the $n$-th Fibonacci number.

* **Root Calculation (`Radice`)**:

  * Use Newton's method to compute the n-th root of a number with high precision.

* **Power Calculation (`Potenza`)**:

  * Raise a number to any integer exponent. Handles both positive and negative exponents, returning the computed value.

* **Trigonometric Functions**:

  * `Sen` Calculate the sine of an angle using a Taylor series approximation.
  * `Cos`: Calculate the cosine of an angle using a Taylor series approximation.
  * `Tan`: Calculate the tangent of an angle. The function checks for values where the tangent is undefined (e.g., when the cosine is close to zero).

### **4. Utility Functions**

Streamline your workflows with these utility features:

* **String Conversion (`UniformaString`)**:

  * Convert strings to lowercase for easier comparisons and uniformity.

* **Logging with Timestamps (`Logging`)**:

  * Log detailed messages with timestamps for debugging and tracking program behavior. Logs are written to both the console and a file.

  **Logging Features**:

  * Supports rotating log files when the log file reaches a specified maximum number of lines (default: 1000).
  * Creates log directories (`./Logs/`) if they don't exist.
  * Logs messages to both the console (with timestamps and log level) and a log file.
  * Allows for custom log types (e.g., "INFO", "ERROR", "CLOSE").
  * If the log reaches the maximum line limit, it automatically renames the old logs and creates a new one.

### **5. Mathematical Constants**

* **Pi**: The value of Ï€ is defined as `Pi` for easy reference in computations.

---

### **6. Physical Quantities Conversion**

* **Gradi to Radiente**: Convert degrees to radians using `Gradi_Radiente`.
* **Radiante to Gradi**: Convert radians to degrees using `Radiente_Gradi`.
